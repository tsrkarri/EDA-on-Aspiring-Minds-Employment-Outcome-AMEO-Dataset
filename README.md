# EDA-on-Aspiring-Minds-Employment-Outcome-AMEO-Dataset
The dataset, derived from the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO) study by Aspiring Minds, focuses solely on engineering students. It encompasses employment results such as salary, job titles, and job locations as dependent variables. Additionally, it includes standardized scores for cognitive skills, technical skills, and personality traits, alongside demographic information. With roughly 40 independent variables and 4000 data points, the dataset comprises a mixture of continuous and categorical variables, each candidate being uniquely identified.
## Objective
The main objective is to analyse the AMEO dataset with target variable as Salary. A thorough analysis is required to understand the factors that influence and donâ€™t influence the salary column. This can be achieved through Exploratoty Data Analysis (EDA), starting with understanding, cleaning, and transforming the data.

## Conclusions
To conclude there are many factors that affect the salary of a candidate.
The City at where the job is located (State and City), the designation, the degree of a candidate effect the salary.
Most people pursued courses such as CSE and ECE and most of the colleges are from Uttar Pradesh State.
Most of the jobs are in Banglore City and most of the candidates have studied in CBSE Board only.
Most of the candidates did B.tech about 92% of them only 0.03% of them have a degree in M.Sc (Tech)
The highest salaries are found in Mumbai city, but when seen in terms of state the highest is in Jammu & Kashmir
Both the Hypothesis in Research Questions 1 and 2 turned out to be True.
